1. Need to dedicate some of the operations to the GPU, Example includes Convolution
- We can use Tensorflow specifically for optimisation of these processes, everything else can be same..
2. Remove the duplicated functions.. 
    - Example includes The adma optimiser function on both Conv2D and Dense Class..
3. Fix video loading issues - current approach using JavaScript and HTML video tags isn't reliable across environments
   - Consider using embedded images or GIFs instead of videos for demonstrations
   - Alternatively, provide direct links to hosted videos that work in all environments

4. Improve computational efficiency beyond GPU
   - Replace manual convolution loops with vectorized operations where possible
   - Consider using NumPy's optimized functions instead of explicit loops in MaxPool2D and other layers
   - Pre-allocate memory for large operations to avoid repeated reallocations

5. Enhance error handling and user experience
   - Provide more descriptive error messages for common failure modes
   - Add progress bars using tqdm for long-running operations like training
   - Add early stopping functionality to prevent overfitting

6. Improve code organization and reusability
   - Move the Layer classes into a separate module that can be imported
   - Create a utility module for commonly used functions (like Adam optimizer)
   - Create model architecture factory functions for common patterns

7. Path handling improvements
   - Add a configuration system to handle paths for different environments (local vs Colab)
   - Use relative paths where possible to improve portability
   - Add data download functionality to fetch datasets if not present

8. Visualization enhancements
   - Add functions to visualize learned filters/kernels
   - Implement confusion matrix visualization for classification results
   - Create training history visualization (loss/accuracy over epochs)

9. Model architecture updates
   - Add support for residual connections (ResNet-style)
   - Implement batch normalization layers for improved training stability
   - Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting
   - Support for different padding strategies (same, valid)

10. Memory management
    - Clear memory after large operations
    - Add option to use memory-efficient mode for large datasets
    - Implement batch processing for prediction on large datasets

11. Testing/validation improvements
    - Add K-fold cross-validation support
    - Implement metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1)
    - Add support for data augmentation during training
